# HumanUnity – HCI Project (Interazione Uomo-Macchina)

HumanUnity is a web application designed to support students and university staff in dealing with racial/ethnic discrimination episodes in educational contexts.  
The system helps users **recognize an episode**, get **immediate guidance**, **document it safely**, and **submit a report** (either quick or detailed), with a traceable follow-up.

This project was developed following the course assignments for Human-Computer Interaction.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Provide a simple and safe space to understand whether an episode is discrimination.
- Reduce the fear of reporting through anonymity and guided flows.
- Enable a **quick report (1 minute)** or a **detailed step-by-step report (wizard)**.
- Offer case tracking for users and follow-up tools for university referents.

---

## 🧩 Main Features
**For students / witnesses**
- Guided episode recognition.
- “What can I do now?” section with low-risk immediate actions.
- Quick reporting (few fields, saved as draft to complete later).
- Detailed reporting in 4 steps with a progress tracker.
- “Your cases” area to check status and updates.

**For referents**
- Case dashboard with status, date, and category.
- Case detail page with timeline and follow-up actions.
- Filters and search for fast case management.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

HumanUnity is a **stand-alone web app**, accessible from any modern browser.  
No real backend is required at this stage. User data and cases are simulated locally using **browser localStorage**, keeping the experience simple and private.
